# Short-Term Mean Reversal - Lavine Version

Use this skill for Q58 research: rank A-shares by their trailing five-market-session return, buy the bottom decile and short the top decile. Signals use the decision close, execution is delayed to the next market close, and positions are held for five market sessions.

## Core Workflow

1. Load post-adjusted daily closes from PandaData, a verified resumable request cache, or a frozen offline file.
2. At each decision date, expose only rows dated on or before that date.
3. Require valid closes on both the decision date and exactly five market sessions earlier.
4. Use PandaData's official SH calendar and exclude decision-date rows marked suspended, ST or non-tradable.
5. Select deterministic bottom/top deciles, with 0.5 long and 0.5 short gross notional.
6. Leave missing, suspended, ST or directionally limit-blocked entries in cash. In `daily_nav` mode, carry blocked exits and retry every market session while reserving their side budget.
7. Measure returns from the next market close through the close five sessions later.
8. Deduct one-way costs from drift-adjusted traded notional, an optional annualized short borrow fee, and report Rank IC, turnover, coverage and drawdown.

## Execution Modeling (2.0.0)

- **Borrow availability**: an optional point-in-time `borrowable` column gates short entries. A short target that is not borrowable at the entry session is left in cash with reason `not_borrowable`. Without the column the capability is reported `borrowable_flag: false` and shorts are treated as borrowable (unmodeled).
- **Short borrow fee**: `--short-fee-rate` is an annualized fee charged on short notional while held. Period mode charges `rate * hold_days/252 * |short executed weight|`; `daily_nav` mode accrues `rate/252 * short mark value` each session. Default `0.0` keeps legacy results unchanged.
- **Delisting settlement price**: an optional symbol-level `delisting_settlement_price` column, combined with `de_listed_date`, provides a verifiable post-delisting settlement value. When a held position's security delists within the holding window, the position settles at that price on the delisting date (`delisting_settlement_exit`) instead of failing closed. Without the column the historical fail-closed behavior is unchanged.

## Run

Install and run the deterministic demo first:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/backtest.py --provider demo --start 20220101 --end 20241231 `
  --evidence-output output/demo-evidence.parquet --output output/demo.json
python scripts/validate.py output/demo.json --evidence output/demo-evidence.parquet
python scripts/backtest.py --provider demo --accounting-mode daily_nav `
  --start 20220101 --end 20241231 --output output/demo-daily.json
python scripts/validate.py output/demo-daily.json
```

Run the multi-year chronological out-of-sample validation on synthetic data:

```powershell
python scripts/oos_validation.py --provider demo `
  --start 20210101 --end 20251231 --accounting-mode daily_nav `
  --output output/oos-demo-daily.json
```

Run a frozen CSV or Parquet panel containing `date`, `symbol`, and post-adjusted `close`:

```powershell
python scripts/backtest.py --provider file --input data/daily.parquet `
  --accounting-mode daily_nav --start 20210101 --end 20251231 `
  --cost-rate 0.001 --short-fee-rate 0.06 --output output/backtest.json
```

PandaData credentials are read from environment variables:

```powershell
$env:PANDA_DATA_USERNAME = "your-account"
$env:PANDA_DATA_PASSWORD = "your-password"
python scripts/backtest.py --provider pandadata --all-a `
  --accounting-mode daily_nav `
  --start 20210101 --end 20251231 `
  --cache-dir output/panda-cache `
  --delisting-exit-policy last_available_close `
  --output output/backtest.json
```

## Output Contract

The JSON records the complete strategy configuration, source status, input-panel SHA-256, request-manifest SHA-256 and deterministic run ID. Recommended `daily_nav` output contains every close mark, signed position, cash balance, entry/exit attempt, observed trading state, cost and retry, allowing the validator to replay the ledger independently. Period mode retains optional full cross-sectional Parquet evidence so the validator can reconstruct tails and Rank IC. PandaData remains `experimental` because delisting settlement and short-borrow execution are not fully evidenced.

Use `scripts/summarize.py` only after `scripts/validate.py` passes. `last_available_close` permits an exit attempt at the final observed close but does not override suspension or price-limit blocks; absent a verifiable post-delisting settlement value, an open position still fails closed. The default delisting policy remains `error`.

## Safety Boundary

The long-short portfolio is a factor research diagnostic, not a directly executable A-share cash-equity strategy. A-shares cannot generally be shorted; borrow availability, fees, recall, queue priority, intraday slippage and forced delisting outcomes are only partially modeled. Daily limit-up/limit-down closes block directionally impossible actions but do not prove an executable fill away from the limit. A `borrowable` column and `delisting_settlement_price` improve the model but remain data-driven inputs the user must source and verify. Do not describe demo or backtest output as live performance or investment advice.

Read `references/methodology.md` and `references/data_guide.md` before interpreting results.
